# Make

## What it is

Make is a command-line tool from the 1970s. You describe **targets** (things you want) in a file called `Makefile`.
Each target lists what it needs first and the commands that produce it. You then type `make <target>` and Make runs
the commands. It also skips work that is already done, by comparing file dates.

People use it today less to compile programs and more as a short, standard name for project commands.

## Why this repository uses it

Every repository in this series answers three questions with the same three commands: `make run`, `make test`,
`make lint`. A reader who has never seen the project can type them without reading anything else. Make also keeps
the commands the same on a laptop and in CI.

## Where it appears

| File | What it does with this technology |
| --- | --- |
| `Makefile` | Defines the targets listed in `make help`. |
| .github/workflows/ci.yml | Calls `make check`, `make audit`, `make test-e2e`, `make run` and `make verify`. |
| .editorconfig | Tells editors to use real tab characters in `Makefile`. |
| .env / .env.example | Make reads `.env` with `-include` and exports it. |
| README.md | Every command in the proof table is a `make` target. |

## How it works underneath

1. You run `make test`. Make reads `Makefile` from the current folder.
2. It finds the rule whose target is `test`. It looks at the prerequisites (`$(STAMP)`).
3. For each prerequisite it checks whether there is a rule to build it and whether the file is older than its own
   prerequisites. If so it builds it first. A prerequisite that is not a file (a `.PHONY` name) always runs.
4. It then runs the recipe. **Each recipe line runs in its own new shell** (`/bin/sh`, not your terminal). So a `cd`
   on one line does not affect the next line, and shell variables do not carry over.
5. If a line exits with a status other than 0, Make stops and reports `Error 1` (or similar). Success is status 0.

Make expands `$(NAME)` itself before the shell sees the line. A single `$` in front of a shell variable would have to
be written `$$`; this Makefile does not need that.

## Walkthrough of this repository's use

Make reads the file `Makefile`. A Makefile is a list of **rules**. A rule has a target (a name), optional
prerequisites (what must be ready first) and a recipe (the shell commands that build the target). The recipe lines
start with a tab, not spaces. That is why `.editorconfig` sets `indent_style = tab` for this file.

### The variables at the top

`Makefile`:

```make
PYTHON ?= $(shell command -v python3.13 || command -v python3.12 || command -v python3)
VENV := .venv
PY := $(VENV)/bin/python
STAMP := $(VENV)/.installed
CLI := $(VENV)/bin/pci-scope
```

- `# make up | run | ...` on the first line is only a comment (a line that starts with `#`).
- `PYTHON ?= $(shell command -v python3.13 || command -v python3.12 || command -v python3)` sets `PYTHON` only if it
  is not already set (`?=`). `$(shell ...)` runs a shell command and uses its output. `command -v NAME` prints the
  path of a program if it exists and prints nothing (and fails) if it does not. The `||` means "if the left side
  failed, try the right side". So the line picks Python 3.13, else 3.12, else any `python3`.
- `VENV := .venv` uses `:=`, which evaluates the right side once, right now. `.venv` is the folder of the
  virtual environment (see `venv-and-pip.md`).
- `PY := $(VENV)/bin/python` and `CLI := $(VENV)/bin/pci-scope` build paths from earlier variables. `$(VENV)` means
  "the value of VENV". Using these paths means no one has to "activate" the environment.
- `STAMP := $(VENV)/.installed` names an empty marker file. Its date says when the install last finished.

`Makefile`:

```make
-include .env
export
```

- `-include .env` reads the file `.env` if it exists. The leading `-` means "do not fail if it is missing". The
  file holds lines like `EVIDENCE_DIR=.`, which Make reads as variable assignments.
- `export` with nothing after it makes every Make variable visible to the programs Make starts. That is how
  `pci-scope` sees `EVIDENCE_DIR` and the other settings without any extra code.

`Makefile`:

```make
.PHONY: help install env up db run verify scope scan queries serve-provider serve-merchant serve-naive docker-build test \
```

`.PHONY` lists targets that are **not files**. Without it, a file called `test` or `check` in the folder would make
Make think the target is already built and skip it.

### The targets

`Makefile`:

```make
help: ## list the targets
	@grep -hE '^[a-z-]+:.*## ' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sed -E 's/:.*## /\t/' | sort
```

`help` prints every target with its `##` description. The pipeline is explained in `bash.md`. The `@` at the start of
the recipe line tells Make not to echo the command before running it.

`Makefile`:

```make
$(STAMP): requirements-dev.lock pyproject.toml
	$(PYTHON) -m venv $(VENV)
	$(VENV)/bin/pip install -q --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.lock
	$(VENV)/bin/pip install -q --no-deps -e .
	touch $@
```

This is the one rule that builds a real file. `$(STAMP): requirements-dev.lock pyproject.toml` says: the marker
`.venv/.installed` depends on the lock file and `pyproject.toml`. Make compares file dates. If either input is newer
than the marker, or the marker is missing, Make runs the recipe. Otherwise it skips it. That makes every other target
fast after the first time.
- Line 1 makes the virtual environment folder.
- Line 2 installs the exact, hash-checked packages from the lock file (`pip install --require-hashes`).
- Line 3 installs this project itself in editable mode without touching dependencies (`--no-deps -e .`).
- `touch $@` creates or refreshes the marker. `$@` is Make's automatic variable for "the target of this rule".

`Makefile`:

```make
install: $(STAMP) ## create .venv from the hash-pinned lock file
```

`install` is just a friendly name for the stamp: it has the stamp as a prerequisite and no recipe of its own.

`Makefile`:

```make
env:
	@[ -f .env ] || { cp .env.example .env; echo "created .env from .env.example"; }
```

`env` copies `.env.example` to `.env` the first time, and does nothing afterwards. It has no `##`, so `make help`
hides it: it is a helper, not a command for people.

`Makefile`:

```make
up: env $(STAMP) ## prepare the environment (there are no services to start)
```

`up` means "get ready to run". Here that is the `.env` file and the virtual environment. The lesson template calls
the target `up` for every repository, even when there are no services to start.


`Makefile`:

```make
db: $(STAMP) ## create the merchant's order table with sql/001_schema.sql and the sample rows of sql/002_seed.sql
	$(CLI) db
```

`db` creates the merchant's SQLite database from `sql/` by calling the program (`pci-scope db`).

`Makefile`:

```make
run: up ## the lesson's scenario: naive checkout, redesign, proof, scope, evidence pack, verification
	$(CLI) demo
```

`run` first makes sure `up` is done, then runs the whole scenario with `pci-scope demo`: the naive checkout, the redesign, the proof, the scope, the evidence pack and its verification.
This is the command the README's "Done when" table points at.

`Makefile`:

```make
verify: $(STAMP) ## check that every requirement maps to evidence and every file says what it should
	$(CLI) verify

scope: $(STAMP) ## print the cardholder data environment before and after, and what changed
	$(CLI) scope
```

`verify` checks the evidence pack against the requirements; `scope` prints the cardholder data environment before and after; `scan` searches a folder for card
numbers (`make scan PATHS="state evidence"`: `$(PATHS)` is a Make variable you give on the command line); `queries` runs the SQL file with the `sqlite3` program.

`Makefile`:

```make
serve-provider: $(STAMP) ## run the local payment provider on its port
	$(CLI) serve provider

serve-merchant: $(STAMP) ## run the redesigned merchant on its port
	$(CLI) serve merchant

serve-naive: $(STAMP) ## run the naive checkout (to be measured, test card only)
	$(CLI) serve naive
```

Each `serve-*` target starts one app on its configured port. The naive one is "to be measured, test card only".

`Makefile`:

```make
test: $(STAMP) ## unit tests with coverage (domain and application must stay at 95% or more)
	$(PY) -m pytest tests/unit --cov=pci_scope --cov-report=term
	$(PY) -m coverage report --include='src/pci_scope/domain/*,src/pci_scope/application/*' --fail-under=95
```

`test` runs the unit tests under coverage and requires 95 percent in `domain/` and `application/`. `test-e2e` runs the end-to-end scenario selected by `-m e2e`.

`Makefile`:

```make
lint: $(STAMP) ## ruff check, ruff format check, mypy, import-linter
	$(VENV)/bin/ruff check .
	$(VENV)/bin/ruff format --check .
	$(VENV)/bin/mypy
	$(VENV)/bin/lint-imports
```

`lint` runs ruff, the format check, mypy and import-linter.


`Makefile`:

```make
format: $(STAMP) ## apply ruff's formatting and safe fixes
	$(VENV)/bin/ruff check --fix .
	$(VENV)/bin/ruff format .
```

`Makefile`:

```make
audit: $(STAMP) ## check the locked dependencies for known vulnerabilities
	$(VENV)/bin/pip-audit --no-deps --disable-pip -r requirements-dev.lock
```

`Makefile`:

```make
check: lint test ## everything CI runs apart from the audit
```

`check: lint test` has no recipe. It only lists two prerequisites, so `make check` means "run `lint` and then `test`".
The CI file calls `make check` so that CI and a laptop run the same thing.

`Makefile`:

```make
down: ## remove generated output (nothing is running)
	rm -rf build
```

`Makefile`:

```make
clean: down
	rm -rf $(VENV) .pytest_cache .mypy_cache .ruff_cache .import_linter_cache .coverage htmlcov
```

`down` deletes generated output. `clean` has `down` as a prerequisite and also deletes the virtual environment and
every cache folder. `rm -rf` removes a folder and everything in it without asking.

## Try it yourself

From the repository root:

```bash
make help
```
Expect one line per documented target: `audit`, `check`, `db`, `docker-build`, `down`, `format`, `help`, `install`, `lint`, `queries`, `run`, `scan`, `serve-merchant`, `serve-naive`, `serve-provider`, `test`, `test-e2e`, `up`, `verify`, each followed by a tab and its description.

```bash
make -n test
```
`-n` is a dry run: Make prints the commands it would run and runs none. Expect two lines: the `pytest` line and the
`coverage report` line, with `.venv/bin/python` at the start.

```bash
make -n down
```
Expect `rm -rf build`.

```bash
ls -l .venv/.installed
```
Expect a file of size 0 (after a first `make up`). Run `touch pyproject.toml`, then `make -n up`: Make now shows the
install commands again, because `pyproject.toml` is newer than the marker.

```bash
make run
```
Expect the scenario's output: the scope before and after, `order statuses: ...`, the list of evidence files, and `OK: ... requirements, ... files, 0 problem(s)`.

## Mistakes people make

- **Spaces instead of a tab** in a recipe. Make answers `missing separator`. The `.editorconfig` entry for
  `Makefile` prevents it in most editors.
- **Expecting `cd` to carry over** between recipe lines. It does not; each line has its own shell.
- **Forgetting `.PHONY`** for a target that is not a file. This Makefile lists every command target there.
- **Typing `$VAR` instead of `$(VAR)`** for a Make variable.
- **Running `make` with no target.** It builds the first target in the file, which here is `help`, a harmless choice
  on purpose.

## Check yourself

1. Why does `make test` not reinstall the packages every time?
   **Answer:** The `.venv/.installed` marker is a prerequisite. Make only reruns the install recipe when the lock file or `pyproject.toml` is newer than the marker.
2. What does `export` on its own line do?
   **Answer:** It passes every Make variable, including those read from `.env`, to the programs Make starts.
3. What would break if `.PHONY` did not list `test` and someone created a file named `test`?
   **Answer:** Make would see an existing file with no newer prerequisites and say `test` is up to date, skipping the tests.
4. What does the `@` at the start of a recipe line do?
   **Answer:** It stops Make from printing the command before running it.
5. Why is `check` written with no recipe?
   **Answer:** It only names `lint` and `test` as prerequisites, so running it runs both.
